**Bronze Layer:** Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.

**Silver Layer:** This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.

**Gold Layer:** Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.


**Project Overview:**

**This project involves**:

**1) Data Architecture:** Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

**2) ETL Pipelines:** Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.

**3) Data Modeling:** Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.

**4) Analytics & Reporting:** Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.


**Project Requirements:**

1) Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
2) Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
3) Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
4) Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
5) Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

**BI Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis):**

Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:

**1) Customer Behavior**

**2) Product Performance**

**3) Sales Trends**
